Here's how the distribution of vegetation can affect our environment:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Surface water flow</strong>: Vegetation helps slow down water that flows on the surface of the land. When water flows over plants, it has to move more slowly, kind of like it's taking a winding road. This helps prevent erosion (the wearing away of soil) and gives the water a chance to soak into the ground. Bare areas, with no plants, allow water to flow fast and can cause erosion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Temperature</strong>: Vegetation helps to keep the air around it cooler. Leaves release water into the air through a process called transpiration, which is like a natural air conditioner. When there are lots of plants, this process cools the air, making it more comfortable. In areas with no plants, the sun can heat the ground and air, making it warmer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Air quality</strong>: Trees and plants absorb a type of air pollutant called particulate matter, which is tiny and floats in the air. By absorbing these particles, plants help make the air cleaner. They also give off oxygen when they make food, which humans and animals need to breathe. Without enough plants, there would be more air pollution and less oxygen.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, having a good distribution of vegetation on land helps to control the flow of surface water, keeps the air temperature down, and makes the air cleaner for all living things!</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1242.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1244.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
