Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>Economic Plants:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Rice and Wheat</strong>: These are staple foods for many people around the world. Farmers plant seeds in fields, add water and fertilizers, and harvest the crops when they're ripe.</li><li><strong>Cotton</strong>: Cotton is used to make clothes.
