They are special proteins that speed up chemical reactions that happen inside you. Think of them like superheroes that make things happen faster.</p><p>Some of the jobs that enzymes do:</p><ol><li>Help digest food in your stomach and intestines.</li><li>Build muscles and fix damaged tissues.</li><li>Keep your body at the right temperature.</li><li>Make energy for your body to move around.</li></ol><p><strong>Factors that affect enzyme activity:</strong></p><p>There are several things that can affect how well enzymes work. These include:</p><ol><li><strong>Temperature</strong>: If it's too hot or too cold, enzymes might not work as well. Just like how your body doesn't work well in extreme temperatures.</li><li><strong>pH</strong>: Enzymes work best at a certain level of acidity or alkalinity. Think of it like a special recipe that has the right mix of ingredients.</li><li><strong>Substrate concentration</strong>: Enzymes need the right amount of "food" to work on. If there's too little or too much, they might not work as well.</li><li><strong>Inhibitors</strong>: Some substances can slow down or stop enzyme activity. It's like having a bad guy that tries to stop the superheroes from doing their job.</li></ol><p>So, to sum it up, enzymes are tiny helpers that make things happen in your body, and their activity can be affected by things like temperature, pH, and the right amount of "food" to work on.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1586.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1588.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
