He studied three important laws and used them to create the atomic theory. Let me explain:</p><ol><li><strong>Law of Definite Proportions</strong>: Dalton discovered that when you mix two elements to form a compound, the elements always combine in the same ratio. This means that if you mix one element A with another element B, you'll always get the same proportion of A and B.</li></ol><p>Example: When you mix hydrogen and oxygen to form water, it's always 2 parts of hydrogen and 1 part of oxygen.</p><ol><li><strong>Law of Multiple Proportions</strong>: Dalton found that when two elements combine to form more than one compound, the proportions of the elements are in simple whole number ratios.</li></ol><p>Example: Carbon and oxygen can form two compounds, carbon monoxide (1:1 ratio) and carbon dioxide (1:2 ratio). </p><ol><li><strong>Law of Conservation of Mass</strong>: This law says that matter can't be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means that when elements combine, the total mass of the products is the same as the total mass of the reactants.</li></ol><p>Dalton used these laws and another concept, <strong>elements</strong>, to create the atomic theory:</p><ul><li><strong>Elements</strong>: Dalton knew that elements are substances that can't be broken down into simpler substances. He believed that elements are made up of tiny particles called <strong>atoms</strong>.</li><li><strong>Atoms</strong>: Dalton thought of atoms as the smallest units of elements. He believed that all atoms of an element are the same and that they can't be created or destroyed.</li></ul><p>Here's how Dalton used these ideas to create the atomic theory:</p><ul><li><strong>Atoms are indivisible particles</strong>: Dalton believed that atoms are the basic building blocks of matter and can't be divided further.</li><li><strong>Elements are made of one type of atom</strong>: Each element is made up of only one type of atom.</li><li><strong>Compounds are made of different atoms combined</strong>: When elements combine to form compounds, they form different atoms joined together.</li></ul><p>Dalton's atomic theory helped scientists understand the basics of chemistry and paved the way for future discoveries.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1498.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1500.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
