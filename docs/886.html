Here are a few:</p><ol><li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Scientists are trying to understand how to stop or slow down climate change, which is making the Earth's weather get warmer.</li><li><strong>Finding New Medicines</strong>: Researchers are looking for new ways to cure diseases, but it's hard to find the right combinations of chemicals to make medicines that work.</li><li><strong>Understanding the Brain</strong>: Our brains are very complicated, and scientists are still trying to figure out how they work.</li><li><strong>Protecting Endangered Animals</strong>: Many animals are in danger of becoming extinct, and scientists are trying to find ways to save them.</li><li><strong>Dealing with Microplastics</strong>: Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic that are everywhere, even in our food and water, and scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of them.</li><li><strong>Exploring Space</strong>: Scientists are trying to learn more about the universe and how it was made, but it's hard to send humans and machines to space.</li><li><strong>Studying Rare Events</strong>: Some things in nature, like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, are hard to study because they don't happen very often.</li></ol><p>These are just a few of the challenges that natural scientists are working on.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=885.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=887.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
