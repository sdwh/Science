To keep them organized, we use a system called classification. We group living things based on how they look (morphology) and their internal parts (structure). Here's how:</p><ol><li><strong>Kingdom</strong>: We divide living things into six kingdoms: Animals, Plants, Fungi, Protists, Archaebacteria, and Eubacteria.</li><li><strong>Phylum</strong>: We group living things in each kingdom by their body structure. For example, animals with backbones are in one group (Vertebrates), and those without backbones are in another (Invertebrates).</li><li><strong>Class</strong>: We divide each phylum into smaller groups based on similarities. For example, cats and dogs are in the same class (Mammals) because they have similar body parts.</li><li><strong>Order</strong>: We group living things in each class by their physical characteristics. For example, cats and lions are in the same order (Carnivores) because they are meat-eaters.</li><li><strong>Family</strong>: We group living things in each order by their close relationships. For example, cats and tigers are in the same family (Felidae) because they are closely related.</li><li><strong>Genus</strong>: We group living things in each family by their very close relationships. For example, cats and lions are in different genera, but they are still closely related.</li><li><strong>Species</strong>: We group living things that can breed and produce babies with each other. For example, domestic cats are one species (Felis catus).</li></ol><p>That's how we classify living things based on their morphology and structure!</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1286.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1288.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
