It's created when ethylene gas is mixed with a special liquid and then heated under pressure.</li></ol><p>Structure: Long chain of single-bonded carbon atoms</p><p>Preparation method: Melting and then blowing air through the molten material to make it thin and flexible.</p><ol><li><strong>Nylon clothing - Polyamide</strong>: Made from a chain of nitrogen and carbon atoms. It's created when a liquid containing nitrogen is mixed with a liquid containing carbon, and then heated.</li></ol><p>Structure: Chain of atoms with nitrogen and carbon bonded in a specific order</p><p>Preparation method: Spinning molten polyamide into fibers that can be woven into fabric.</p><ol><li><strong>PVC pipes - Polyvinyl Chloride</strong>: Made from a chain of carbon and chlorine atoms. It's created when vinyl chloride gas is mixed with other chemicals and then heated under pressure.</li></ol><p>Structure: Long chain of bonded carbon and chlorine atoms</p><p>Preparation method: Mixing the raw materials with other chemicals, then heating and molding the mixture into pipes or other shapes.</p><ol><li><strong>Polystyrene foam cups - Styrofoam</strong>: Made from a chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. It's created when styrene gas is mixed with other chemicals and then heated under pressure.</li></ol><p>Structure: Long chain of single-bonded carbon atoms</p><p>Preparation method: Melting and then blowing air through the molten material to make it light and foamy.</p><ol><li><strong>Rubber bands - Polyisoprene (Natural Rubber)</strong>: Made from a chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. It's created when natural latex sap is collected and then treated with other chemicals.</li></ol><p>Structure: Long chain of double-bonded carbon atoms</p><p>Preparation method: Collecting latex sap, adding chemicals to create a chain reaction, and then molding the mixture into various shapes.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1774.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1776.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
