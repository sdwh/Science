Think of a sealed jar with no holes.</p><p>Imagine you have a toy car that runs on batteries (chemical energy). The car starts moving, using up its batteries (converting chemical energy to kinetic energy). Eventually, the car stops because its batteries are empty.</p><p>But here's the thing: the energy didn't just disappear! It transformed into different forms, like heat energy (the car's moving parts heated up) or sound energy (the noise of the car moving).</p><p>This transformation is what we call the <strong>Law of Conservation of Energy</strong>: in an isolated system, energy can't be created or destroyed, only changed from one type to another.</p><p>So, in an isolated system, the total amount of energy remains the same, but it might change forms.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1207.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1209.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
