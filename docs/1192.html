Each LEGO brick is connected in a special way, and it looks amazing. Now, imagine someone comes and knocks down your castle, scattering the LEGO bricks everywhere. It's hard to put it back together exactly as it was, right?</p><p>That's kind of what happens when we alter or destroy natural landscapes and environments. They're made up of many things like plants, animals, soil, and water that are connected in special ways. When we change or damage them, it's hard to put them back together exactly as they were. </p><p>Also, some of these connections are very delicate, and when they're broken, they can't be fixed easily. It's like when you accidentally damage a LEGO brick - you can't put it back to its original shape.</p><p>Additionally, natural environments have been built up over thousands or even millions of years. Trying to restore them in a short period of time is really challenging.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1191.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1193.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
