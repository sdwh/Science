Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><strong>Sharkskin and Swimsuits</strong>: Scientists studied the bumpy skin of sharks that helps them swim faster. They created swimsuits with similar bumps, which reduced drag and made swimmers faster.</li><li><strong>Bird Wings and Airplanes</strong>: The shape of bird wings inspired the design of airplane wings, which helps planes take off and land safely.</li><li><strong>Lotus Leaf and Water Repellent</strong>: The lotus leaf has a special surface that repels water. This inspired the creation of water-repellent materials used in fabrics, umbrellas, and even buildings.</li><li><strong>Geckos and Sticky Tapes</strong>: Geckos have sticky feet that help them climb walls. Scientists studied this and created sticky tapes that can hold heavy objects without leaving residue.</li><li><strong>Whale Fins and Wind Turbines</strong>: The shape of whale fins inspired the design of wind turbine blades, which helps them generate more electricity.</li><li><strong>Spider Silk and Strong Fibers</strong>: Spider silk is incredibly strong and lightweight. Scientists are developing similar fibers for clothing, medical equipment, and even spacecraft.</li></ol><p>These are just a few examples of how nature has inspired human inventions. By studying how animals and plants adapt to their environment, scientists can develop more efficient, effective, and innovative solutions for humans.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1239.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1241.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
