The strength of this force depends on two things:</p><ol><li>The mass of the object (how much 'stuff' it's made of)</li><li>The mass of the celestial body (like the Earth or the moon)</li></ol><p>Imagine you're standing on the Earth. The Earth's gravity is pulling you down, so you have weight. Now, if you were to go to the moon, which is much smaller than the Earth, you would weigh less because the moon's gravity is weaker.</p><p><strong>Mass:</strong> Mass is a measure of how much 'stuff' an object is made of. It's a property of the object itself and doesn't change, no matter where you take it. Think of it like a bowl of cereal - the amount of cereal in the bowl is the same, whether you're on the Earth, the moon, or anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Key difference:</strong> Weight changes depending on the gravity of the celestial body you're on, but mass stays the same. For example, you would weigh less on the moon, but you would still be made up of the same amount of 'stuff', so your mass wouldn't change.</p><p>In short:</p><ul><li>Weight is the force of gravity that depends on the mass of the celestial body and the object's mass.</li><li>Mass is the amount of 'stuff' an object is made of, which remains the same everywhere.</li></ul></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1348.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1350.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
