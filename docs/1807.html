Scientists use two main ways to learn about the Earth's insides: drilling and geophysical exploration.</p><p><strong>Drilling:</strong> When they drill through the Earth's crust, they collect samples of rocks and study them. It's like taking a small bite of the cake to see what's inside. By looking at these rocks, scientists learn about the Earth's composition and structure layer by layer.</p><p><strong>Geophysical Exploration:</strong> This method is like using special tools to look inside the cake without cutting it. There are several ways to do this: 1. <strong>Seismic Waves:</strong> Scientists create small earthquakes and measure how long it takes for the waves to come back. This helps them understand what the Earth's insides are made of and how hot they are. 2. <strong>Gravity:</strong> By measuring the Earth's gravity, scientists can figure out what's inside the Earth and how dense it is. It's like using a super-powerful magnet to feel the weight of the cake's ingredients. 3. <strong>Magnetic Field:</strong> The Earth's magnetic field helps scientists learn about the Earth's core and the magnetism of rocks. 4. <strong>Electrical Resistivity:</strong> This method is like sending a tiny electric current through the Earth to see what's inside. It helps scientists understand the Earth's composition and structure.</p><p>By combining these methods, scientists can create a detailed picture of the Earth's insides and learn about its structure and composition.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1806.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1808.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
