During glacial periods, it's cold, and ice covers a lot of the land. The sea level is low because a lot of water is stuck in the ice. This affects the environment in several ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Animals and plants move</strong>: Many animals and plants can't live in the cold, so they move to warmer areas or even become extinct. This changes the types of animals and plants that live in certain places.</li><li><strong>Ecosystems change</strong>: The cold and ice change the habitats of animals and plants, like forests, tundras, and deserts. This can cause some animals to lose their homes.</li><li><strong>Oceans are different</strong>: The lower sea level exposes more land and changes the way the ocean flows. This affects the types of animals that live in the ocean.</li></ol><p>Now, imagine the seesaw tipping the other way during interglacial periods. It's warmer, and the ice melts. The sea level rises, and this has the opposite effects:</p><ol><li><strong>Animals and plants move again</strong>: As it gets warmer, animals and plants that were waiting for warmer weather can move back to areas they couldn't live in before.</li><li><strong>Ecosystems change again</strong>: The warmer weather changes the habitats again, and some animals and plants thrive in their new environments.</li><li><strong>Oceans go back to normal</strong>: The rising sea level covers the land that was exposed during the glacial period, and the ocean flows change again.</li></ol><p>These changes happen over thousands of years, so it's not like a sudden switch. But it's like a big natural rollercoaster that affects the whole planet and the living things on it.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1581.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1583.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
