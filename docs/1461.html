He wanted to understand how objects move. Here's what he thought:</p><ol><li><strong>He didn't believe Aristotle</strong>: Aristotle said that heavy objects fall faster than light objects. But Galileo wanted to test this idea.</li><li><strong>He did an experiment</strong>: Galileo rolled balls down a ramp to see what would happen. He measured the distance they rolled and the time it took.</li><li><strong>He thought about gravity</strong>: Galileo realized that gravity is what pulls objects down to the ground. He thought that all objects, no matter how heavy or light, fall at the same speed.</li><li><strong>He imagined objects in space</strong>: Galileo thought about what would happen if there was no air resistance. He realized that objects would keep moving at the same speed unless something stopped them.</li><li><strong>He came up with a big idea</strong>: Galileo said that objects in motion will keep moving at the same speed unless something gets in their way. This is called inertia.</li></ol><p>Galileo's ideas changed the way people thought about motion and helped us understand the world better.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1460.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1462.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
