You'll have to adjust to new surroundings, make new friends, and find new places to play. Living things, like animals and plants, also have to adjust when their environment changes.</p><p>Here are some effects a change in environment can have on living things:</p><ol><li><strong>They might move to a new home</strong>: If their new environment is too hot, cold, or dry, they might have to find a new place to live where they can survive.</li><li><strong>Changes in what they eat</strong>: If their favorite food isn't available in the new environment, they might have to find a new food source.</li><li><strong>New daily habits</strong>: They might have to adjust their daily routines, like sleeping, hunting, or migrating, to fit in with the new environment.</li><li><strong>Some might disappear</strong>: If the new environment is too harsh or they can't adapt quickly enough, some living things might disappear from that area altogether.</li></ol><p>Think of polar bears, for example. If the Arctic gets warmer and there's less ice, they might have to move to a new location to find food and shelter. Or imagine plants that need lots of water; if it gets too dry in their area, they might not be able to survive unless they can find a new home with more water.</p><p>So, changes in the environment can really impact how living things live and survive!</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1173.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1175.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
