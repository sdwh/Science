Here's how it works:</p><p><strong>The Circulatory System:</strong></p><ol><li>The heart is like the driver, pumping the delivery truck (blood) through the roads (blood vessels).</li><li>The delivery truck carries oxygen and food from the lungs and digestive system to the cells.</li><li>The cells use the oxygen and food for energy, and in return, they give back waste products like carbon dioxide.</li><li>The delivery truck picks up the waste products and carries them back to the lungs and kidneys to be filtered out.</li></ol><p><strong>Pulse, Heart Rate, and Blood Pressure:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Heart Rate</strong>: This is how many times your heart beats (pumps) per minute. A normal heart rate is around 60-100 beats per minute for kids your age.</li><li><strong>Pulse</strong>: This is the feeling of the heartbeat in your wrist or neck. It's like feeling the truck driving by.</li><li><strong>Blood Pressure</strong>: This is the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as it flows through. Think of it like the truck's tires pressing on the road.</li></ol><p><strong>How it all works together:</strong></p><ol><li>When the heart beats, it pumps blood through the blood vessels, creating a pulse.</li><li>As the blood flows through the vessels, it creates blood pressure, which helps push oxygen and food to all the cells.</li><li>The heart rate and pulse can be checked to see how fast and strong the heart is beating.</li><li>These measurements can help doctors figure out if the circulatory system is working properly or if there are any problems.</li></ol><p>So, to sum it up: the circulatory system is like a delivery truck that carries important stuff to all the cells in your body, and the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure are all important signs that help us make sure it's working correctly.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1236.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1238.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
