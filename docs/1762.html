The reaction will slow down or stop because of the common ion effect.</p><p><strong>Buffer Solution:</strong> Definition: A buffer solution is a mixture of two substances that helps keep the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of a solution stable, even when another acid or base is added.</p><p>Preparation: A buffer solution can be made by mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base or a weak base with its conjugate acid.</p><p>Function: Buffer solutions are used to maintain a stable pH in many applications, such as medicine, biology, and chemistry. They help to prevent big changes in pH that could damage living things or affect chemical reactions.</p><p>Example: Human blood is a natural buffer solution that keeps our body's pH stable.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1761.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1763.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
