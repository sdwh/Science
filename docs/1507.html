When you heat the mixture, the liquid with the lower boiling point will turn into vapor and separate from the rest.</li></ol><p>Example: Separating water from saltwater by boiling it, then collecting the water vapor that turns back into water.</p><ol><li><strong>Extraction</strong>: It's a way to separate substances that don't mix with each other. You use a solvent (like water or another liquid) to extract the substance from the mixture.</li></ol><p>Example: Using oil and water. If you have a mixture of oil and water with a substance dissolved in the oil, you can use a solvent to extract the substance from the oil.</p><ol><li><strong>Chromatography</strong>: It's a method that separates the different parts of a mixture based on how they interact with a surface. Think of it like a big piece of paper that separates colors.</li></ol><p>Example: Imagine a coffee filter that separates the colors in an ink by how much each color sticks to the filter paper.</p><ol><li><strong>Water Softening</strong>: It's a way to remove minerals that make water "hard" (like calcium and magnesium) by exchanging them with other minerals. This makes the water softer and less likely to clog pipes.</li></ol><p>Example: Using special resins to swap the hard minerals for softer ones, making the water better for use.</p><ol><li><strong>Seawater Desalination</strong>: It's a method to remove salt and other minerals from seawater to make it safe to drink. This can be done through distillation, reverse osmosis (forcing water through a filter), or other methods.</li></ol><p>Example: Using a membrane filter to push seawater through and remove the salt, leaving fresh water behind.</p><p>These are the basics of each method. They all help us separate and purify different mixtures in various ways.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1506.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1508.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
