There was no life, just rocks, water, and gases in the air. This is where the process starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Inorganic matter</strong> Rocks, water, and gases contained tiny particles like atoms and molecules. These particles were inorganic, meaning they weren't living things.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Chemical reactions</strong> Some of these particles started to react with each other in the water, like in a big chemical lab. They mixed and formed more complex molecules, like amino acids and nucleotides.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Organic matter</strong> As these reactions continued, they formed the building blocks of life, like sugars, fats, and proteins. These are called organic molecules. They're the same things that living things are made of today.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Nucleic acids</strong> Some of these organic molecules came together to form long, complex chains called nucleic acids (like DNA and RNA).</p><p><strong>Step 5: Reproduction</strong> These nucleic acids can replicate themselves, which means they can make copies of themselves. This is a key feature of life.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Cells</strong> Over time, these organic molecules and nucleic acids came together to form the first cells. These are the basic units of life.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Evolution</strong> The first cells began to evolve, change, and adapt to their environment. This led to the diversity of life we see today, from simple bacteria to complex plants and animals.</p><p>That's a simplified explanation of how life might have originated from inorganic matter.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1614.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1616.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
