This is because the molecules are bumping into each other and into the container walls. When this happens, some molecules get more or less energy, which changes their speed.</p><p>Imagine you're in a crowded playground. Everyone is moving, but some kids are running fast, some are walking, and some are just standing still. This is kind of like what's happening with the gas molecules. They're all moving, but some have more energy (or "oomph") than others, so they're going faster.</p><p>It's also because of something called the "kinetic energy distribution" law. This law says that the energy of the molecules is spread out, or distributed, in a special way, so we get a mix of fast and slow molecules.</p><p>So, it's the combination of the molecules bumping into each other and the way energy is spread out that creates the distribution of speeds in a gas.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1651.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1653.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
