For example, the ancient Greeks thought the Earth was born from a giant egg.</p></li><li><p><strong>400 BC</strong>: The Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested that the Earth was formed from the cooling and hardening of air and water. </p></li><li><p><strong>1600s</strong>: A scientist named James Hutton proposed the 'Cyclical Theory'. He believed that the Earth's surface changed through constant processes like erosion and sedimentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>1830s</strong>: Charles Lyell developed the 'Principle of Uniformitarianism', which says that the Earth's surface was shaped by slow and continuous processes that still happen today.</p></li><li><p><strong>1859</strong>: Charles Darwin published 'The Origin of Species', which introduced the theory of evolution through natural selection.</p></li><li><p><strong>1900s</strong>: Scientists discovered radioactive dating and realized the Earth was much older (around 4.5 billion years) than they thought.</p></li><li><p><strong>1960s</strong>: The theory of plate tectonics was developed, which explains how the Earth's surface is broken into moving plates that create mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Today</strong>: We continue to learn more about the Earth's history and evolution through advanced technology, space exploration, and scientific research.</p></li></ol><p>So, that's a quick journey through how humans thought about the origin and evolution of Earth over time!</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1809.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1811.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
