They're more complex than other types of cells, with things like a nucleus (the cell's control center) and tiny organs inside the cell called organelles.</p><p>About 2 billion years ago, the Earth was home to only simple cells called prokaryotes. These cells didn't have a nucleus or organelles. One day, a prokaryote cell swallowed another cell, but it didn't digest it. This other cell was able to live inside the first cell and even helped it by making energy.</p><p>Over time, the swallowed cell became an organelle called the mitochondria. It did such a great job helping the cell that the cell didn't want to get rid of it. More and more cells swallowed other helpful cells, and these swallowed cells became other organelles.</p><p>Eventually, the cell's genetic material (DNA) got a special protective covering called the nucleus. And just like that, the eukaryotic cell was born! This was a big deal because it allowed cells to become much more complex and diverse, which ultimately led to the development of all sorts of amazing creatures, including you!</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1616.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1618.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
