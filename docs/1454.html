That's because when you convert a tiny bit of mass into energy, you get a huge amount of energy out. This idea is really important for making electricity. Here are some ways it's used:</p><ol><li><strong>Nuclear Power Plants</strong>: They use nuclear fission, which is when an atom splits into smaller pieces, releasing a lot of energy. This energy is used to make steam, which then turns a big wheel to create electricity.</li><li><strong>Nuclear Fusion Research</strong>: Scientists are trying to make nuclear fusion happen, which is when two tiny atoms combine into one bigger atom. If they can make it work, it could be a really clean and powerful way to make electricity.</li><li><strong>Space Exploration</strong>: Nuclear power is used in some spacecraft to give them electricity. It's really good for this because it's small and lasts a long time.</li><li><strong>Submarines and Aircraft Carriers</strong>: The US Navy uses nuclear power in some of its submarines and ships. It gives them the energy they need to move and do their jobs for a long time without needing to refuel.</li><li><strong>Medical Treatments</strong>: Some hospitals use radiation therapy, which is a type of nuclear energy, to help treat cancer.</li></ol><p>These are just a few examples, but they show how important mass conversion to energy is for making electricity and powering things that are really important to us.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1453.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1455.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
