The energy from the batteries makes the car move. But, when you connect the batteries to a lamp, the lamp uses some of that energy to light up. Then, if you connect the lamp to a heater, some of the energy from the heater goes into making the air warm.</p><p>The thing is, when energy changes from one form to another (like from electricity to light, or from light to heat), some of it gets wasted. This is because energy can't be converted 100% from one form to another perfectly. Some of it turns into heat, which we can't use for anything important.</p><p>This doesn't break the rule of energy conservation, which says that energy can't be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. But, it does mean that the energy we can use gets smaller and smaller, even if the total amount of energy stays the same.</p><p>Think of it like a big pie that's cut into smaller and smaller pieces. Even if all the pieces add up to the same amount, the useful pieces get smaller and smaller. That's why the effectiveness of energy decreases when its form is converted.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1496.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1498.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
