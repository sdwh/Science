Here's a simplified history of it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>1865: Gregor Mendel's Experiments</strong>: Mendel discovered the laws of heredity while working with pea plants. He found out that traits like plant height and flower color are inherited in certain patterns.</p></li><li><p><strong>1880s: Walther Flemming Sees Chromosomes</strong>: Flemming discovered chromosomes while studying cells under a microscope. However, he didn't know how they were connected to heredity.</p></li><li><p><strong>1900s: Theodor Boveri and Walter Sutton's Breakthrough</strong>: Boveri and Sutton figured out that chromosomes have something to do with heredity. They realized that chromosomes are found in the nucleus of cells, and they come in pairs.</p></li><li><p><strong>1902-1903: Thomas Morgan's Fruit Fly Experiments</strong>: Morgan worked with fruit flies to study their traits. He discovered that certain traits are linked to specific chromosomes.</p></li><li><p><strong>1910s: Morgan's Chromosomal Theory</strong>: Morgan combined his findings with those of Mendel, Flemming, and others. He proposed that genes (which are found on chromosomes) carry traits from one generation to the next.</p></li><li><p><strong>1913: Alfred Sturtevant Creates the First Genetic Map</strong>: Sturtevant, a student of Morgan's, mapped out the location of genes on a chromosome. This helped scientists understand how genes are arranged and how they influence traits.</p></li></ol><p>The chromosomal theory of heredity is still an important idea in genetics today. It explains how our DNA, which is stored in our chromosomes, determines our traits and characteristics.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1634.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1636.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
