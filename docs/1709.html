But instead of just standing still, they're all dancing around the room.</p><p>In the same way, electrons in an atom are like those dancing people. They're always moving around the nucleus (center) of the atom, but because they're so small and fast, we can't exactly say where they are at any given moment.</p><p>In classical physics, we would think that we could know exactly where they are, like in a picture. But in quantum mechanics, because of something called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we can only know the probability of where they might be.</p><p>So, we can't draw a definite orbit or path for the electrons, like a circle around the nucleus. Instead, we use a special kind of map called an electron cloud, which shows the probability of where the electrons are likely to be.</p><p>This map looks like a foggy cloud around the nucleus, with darker areas where the electrons are more likely to be. This is why electrons in an atom appear in a probabilistic distribution, or "cloud," rather than following a fixed orbit.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1708.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1710.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
