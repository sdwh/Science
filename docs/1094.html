As these animals evolved over time, their bodies changed to adapt to their environments. Despite having different lifestyles and environments, many animals kept the basic form of head, body, and limbs.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this:</p><ol><li><strong>Everything needs a control center</strong>: The head usually contains the brain, which helps animals think, make decisions, and sense their surroundings.</li><li><strong>A body provides protection and support</strong>: The body protects vital organs like the heart, lungs, and stomach, and it also gives animals a stable base to move around.</li><li><strong>Limbs help with movement and interaction</strong>: Arms, legs, and other limbs allow animals to move, grab food, and interact with their environment.</li></ol><p>Since these basic parts are so useful, they have been kept in many different animal groups. However, over time, each group has evolved special features that help them survive in their unique environments.</p><p>For example, a bird's "limbs" are wings, which are great for flying, while a dolphin's "limbs" are flippers, which are perfect for swimming. Despite these differences, both animals still have a head, body, and limbs that help them function and survive.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1093.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1095.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
