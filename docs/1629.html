Here's how:</p><p><strong>Interactions between Species:</strong> When different animals and plants live together, they interact in various ways. These interactions can be:</p><ol><li>Mutually beneficial (help each other)</li><li>Harmful (one species hurts another)</li><li>Neutral (no effect on each other)</li></ol><p>Examples: - Bees help flowers by pollinating them, and flowers give bees nectar. - Wolves hurt deer by hunting them. - Trees and grasses grow near each other, but don't really affect each other.</p><p><strong>Community Structure:</strong> A community is a group of different species living together. It has different levels: 1. Producers (plants) make food from sunlight. 2. Consumers (animals) eat plants or other animals. 3. Decomposers (like bacteria) break down dead things.</p><p>A healthy community has a balance of these levels and many species working together.</p><p><strong>Succession:</strong> Succession is the process of change in a community over time. It happens when a community is disrupted, like after a fire or flood. There are two types: 1. Primary succession: A new community forms in an empty area, like a new island. 2. Secondary succession: A community recovers from a disaster, like a forest regrowing after a fire.</p><p>Here's how it works: 1. Quick-growing species (like grasses) move in first. 2. Small trees and shrubs follow. 3. Larger trees and animals arrive later. 4. The community becomes more balanced and stable over time.</p><p>These three concepts are connected: interactions between species shape the community structure, which can change through succession. It's like a big, dynamic puzzle, where each species is a piece that fits together to create a thriving ecosystem.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1628.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1630.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
