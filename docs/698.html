It's created by the wings, which are curved on top and flat on the bottom. As the plane moves forward, air flows over and under the wing, creating an upward force called lift.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: Weight is the downward force that pulls the plane towards the ground. It's the combined weight of the plane, passengers, cargo, and fuel.</li><li><strong>Thrust</strong>: Thrust is the forward force that propels the plane through the air. It's created by the plane's engines, which push air backwards.</li><li><strong>Drag</strong>: Drag is the backward force that slows the plane down. It's created by air resistance.</li></ol><p><strong>What Makes Airplanes Safe:</strong></p><p>Airplanes are safe because of many safety features and procedures:</p><ol><li><strong>Strong and sturdy design</strong>: Airplanes are built to withstand turbulence and other stresses.</li><li><strong>Regular maintenance</strong>: Planes are regularly checked and maintained to ensure that they're in good working condition.</li><li><strong>Trained pilots</strong>: Pilots undergo extensive training to learn how to fly safely and handle emergencies.</li><li><strong>Air traffic control</strong>: Air traffic controllers guide planes through takeoff, landing, and flight to avoid collisions.</li><li><strong>Safety gear</strong>: Planes are equipped with safety gear like seatbelts, life jackets, and oxygen masks.</li><li><strong>Strict safety rules</strong>: Airlines follow strict safety rules and regulations to minimize risks.</li></ol><p>By combining these forces and safety features, airplanes can fly safely and take you to your destination.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=697.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=699.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
