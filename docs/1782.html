Aluminum (Al)</strong> - Preparation: Aluminum is made from a type of rock called bauxite. - Compound: Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) - used in ceramics and glass. - Properties: Aluminum is lightweight and conducts electricity well. - Use: Aluminum is used in cans, airplanes, and electrical wires.</p><p><strong>2. Copper (Cu)</strong> - Preparation: Copper is found in its natural form or extracted from ores. - Compound: Copper oxide (CuO) - used in electronics and glass. - Properties: Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity and heat. - Use: Copper is used in electrical wiring, electronic devices, and pipes.</p><p><strong>3. Iron (Fe)</strong> - Preparation: Iron is extracted from iron ore. - Compound: Iron oxide (Fe2O3) - also known as rust, it's used in paint. - Properties: Iron is strong and can conduct electricity. - Use: Iron is used in steel production, tools, and machines.</p><p><strong>4. Silicon (Si)</strong> - Preparation: Silicon is extracted from sand. - Compound: Silicon dioxide (SiO2) - also known as sand, it's used in glass and concrete. - Properties: Silicon is an excellent semiconductor, meaning it conducts electricity under certain conditions. - Use: Silicon is used in electronics, solar panels, and computer chips.</p><p><strong>5. Zinc (Zn)</strong> - Preparation: Zinc is extracted from zinc ore. - Compound: Zinc oxide (ZnO) - used in sunscreen and paint. - Properties: Zinc is a good conductor of electricity and protects other metals from rust. - Use: Zinc is used in batteries, galvanized metals, and alloys.</p><p><strong>6. Tin (Sn)</strong> - Preparation: Tin is extracted from tin ore. - Compound: Tin oxide (SnO2) - used in glass and ceramics. - Properties: Tin is a good conductor of electricity and resistant to corrosion. - Use: Tin is used in soldering electronic devices and protecting other metals.</p><p>These are some common metals and their compounds, along with their properties and uses.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1781.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1783.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
