Here are a few examples: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Marie Curie (Female, Polish)</strong>: She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She discovered the elements Polonium and Radium, which are used in medicine and science.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (Female, British-American)</strong>: She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard. She discovered that stars are mainly made of hydrogen and helium.</p></li><li><p><strong>George Washington Carver (Male, African-American)</strong>: He was a scientist and inventor who found over 300 uses for peanuts, including peanut butter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Satyendra Nath Bose (Male, Indian)</strong>: He discovered the 'Bose-Einstein Statistics' which is a rule in physics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rosalind Franklin (Female, British-Jewish)</strong>: She helped discover the structure of DNA. Without her work, James Watson and Francis Crick wouldn't have been able to make their famous model of DNA.</p></li><li><p><strong>Antonio Meucci (Male, Italian)</strong>: An inventor who made important discoveries in chemistry and physics, particularly in the development of the 'Sulfide process', which helped to make phone cables.</p></li></ol><p>These people, and many others, showed that anyone can make a difference in science, no matter where they come from.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1528.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1530.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
