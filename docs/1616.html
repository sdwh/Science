It started with tiny things called prokaryotic cells, which are like simple houses for life. Here's how they evolved:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Beginning (3.5 billion years ago):</strong> The Earth had no living things, but it had something called "primordial soup" - a mixture of chemicals in the ocean. These chemicals combined to form tiny things like amino acids and nucleotides.</p></li><li><p><strong>Building Blocks (3.5 billion years ago):</strong> These amino acids and nucleotides came together to form even bigger molecules called proteins and RNA (a type of molecule that stores genetic information).</p></li><li><p><strong>First Life Forms (3.8-4 billion years ago):</strong> These bigger molecules somehow managed to combine in a way that created the very first living things - tiny, simple cells without a nucleus (a type of cell called a prokaryote).</p></li><li><p><strong>Prokaryotic Cells (3.5-4 billion years ago):</strong> These first cells were very simple. They didn't have a nucleus (where the genetic information is stored in a more complex cell). They just had a cell membrane, some genetic material called DNA, and some basic parts that helped them survive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evolution and Changes (3.5 billion years ago - now):</strong> Over time, these simple cells evolved (changed) through a process called natural selection. The cells that were best suited to their environment survived and had babies (called reproduction). This led to many different types of prokaryotic cells.</p></li></ol><p>Prokaryotic cells are still alive today and are found in many different environments. They are a crucial part of the food chain, helping to break down dead things and recycle nutrients.</p><p>That's a simple overview of how prokaryotic cells evolved!</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1615.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1617.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
