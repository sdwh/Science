Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><strong>Desert Cactus</strong>: They have thick, waxy stems to store water and sharp spines to protect themselves from animals that might try to eat them.</li><li><strong>Rainforest Plants</strong>: They have big leaves to catch as much sunlight as possible in the shade and strong roots to hold them up in the wet soil.</li><li><strong>Seaweed</strong>: They live in the ocean and have special roots that help them stay stuck to rocks, so they don't get washed away.</li><li><strong>Mangle Trees</strong>: They grow in salty water and have special roots that help them breathe air above the water.</li><li><strong>Moss and Lichens</strong>: They grow in cold, damp places and can survive with very little water and sunlight.</li></ol><p>These are just a few examples, but all plants adapt to their environment in unique ways to help them survive and grow.</p><p>Other types of plants include: - <strong>Grasses</strong>: They have thin blades and strong roots to help them grow in many different environments. - <strong>Flowering plants</strong>: They have beautiful flowers to attract animals that help them make seeds. - <strong>Shrubs</strong>: They have strong stems and branches to help them grow in many different environments. - <strong>Vines</strong>: They have long stems that help them climb up other plants or structures.</p><p>Plants are amazing and can be found in almost every environment on Earth.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=969.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=971.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
