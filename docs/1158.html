These lines are like strings, and they go from one end of the magnet (the north pole) to the other end (the south pole).</p><p>Now, when you bring two magnets close:</p><ul><li>If you put the same poles (two north or two south) near each other, their lines of force are like strings trying to push each other apart. This makes them repel or push away from each other.</li><li>If you put different poles (one north and one south) near each other, their lines of force are like strings that connect and hold together. This makes them attract or pull towards each other.</li></ul><p>Magnets also attract iron-containing objects because the iron has tiny magnetic particles in it. When a magnet is near, it aligns these particles, creating a magnetic force that makes the iron object move towards the magnet.</p><p>Think of it like a game where magnets are playing with invisible lines of force. When the lines match up (north to south), they hold hands, and when they don't match (north to north or south to south), they push away.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1157.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1159.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
