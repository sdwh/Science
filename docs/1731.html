They're made of the same pieces, but arranged in a different way.</p><p>Isomers are like those two LEGO creations. They're molecules that are made of the same atoms, but arranged in a different way. This means they have the same number and type of atoms, but the atoms are connected in a different order.</p><p>There are different types of isomers:</p><ol><li><strong>Structural isomers</strong>: They have the same molecular formula, but a different arrangement of atoms. It's like rearranging the LEGOs to make a different shape.</li><li><strong>Stereoisomers</strong>: They have the same molecular formula and arrangement of atoms, but they're mirror images of each other, like left and right hands.</li></ol><p>The structure and function of isomers can be very different, even if they're made of the same atoms. This is because the arrangement of atoms can affect how the molecule works and what it does in the body.</p><p>Think of it like this: a house and a castle might be made of the same LEGOs, but they serve very different purposes. One is for living, and the other is for defending. Isomers work in a similar way – they're made of the same building blocks, but they can have very different functions.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1730.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1732.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
