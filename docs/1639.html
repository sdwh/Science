There are three ways to do it: </p><ol><li><strong>Conservative</strong>: Make a brand new bridge using all new Lego pieces.</li><li><strong>Semi-conservative</strong>: Break the old bridge into two halves, and then use each half to make a new bridge, using half-new Lego pieces.</li><li><strong>Dispersion</strong>: Break the old bridge into tiny pieces, mix them up, and then use those pieces to make two brand new bridges.</li></ol><p><strong>DNA replication</strong> is like copying a Lego bridge, but it's how cells make a copy of their DNA.</p><p>In the 1950s, <strong>Watson and Crick</strong> discovered the double helix structure of DNA. But they didn't know how cells make copies of it.</p><p><strong>Meselson and Stahl</strong> (1957-1958) did an experiment to figure this out. They used a special kind of DNA that they could track. Here's what they did:</p><ol><li>They grew bacteria in a special nutrient that had a heavy version of a certain atom (called nitrogen).</li><li>Then, they moved the bacteria to a nutrient that had a light version of that same atom.</li><li>They let the bacteria grow for a while and then took a look at their DNA.</li></ol><p>What they found was that the DNA of the bacteria had a mix of heavy and light atoms. This meant that the old DNA was being used as a template to make new DNA, and the new DNA was using half-old and half-new pieces. This is the <strong>semi-conservative</strong> model.</p><p>Their experiment proved that DNA replication works like the semi-conservative way of making a Lego bridge: break the old DNA into two halves, and use each half to make a new DNA, using half-new pieces.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1638.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1640.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
