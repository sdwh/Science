These plates are always moving, sometimes rubbing against each other. When they do, it creates a lot of stress that can lead to two main things: Earthquakes and Volcanoes.</p><p>Earthquakes happen when the plates suddenly move, releasing the stress as a big shake. Volcanoes happen when the plates push against each other and melt the Earth's mantle, causing lava to rise to the surface.</p><p>Since the plates are moving and interacting, earthquakes and volcanoes often happen in the same areas. This is called the 'Ring of Fire' and it's a 40,000 km long zone around the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanoes occur.</p><p>The reason they coincide in specific areas is because these areas are where the tectonic plates meet or move apart. For example, when two plates collide, they can create a volcano as the Earth's mantle melts. When they pull apart, they can create a fissure or a new sea, which can also lead to earthquakes and volcanoes.</p><p>So, to sum it up, the global distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes coincides in specific areas because of the movement and interaction of tectonic plates. This is why we see many earthquakes and volcanoes happening along the Ring of Fire and other areas where the plates meet or move apart.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1295.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1297.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
