He's known for figuring out how the planets in our solar system move. Here's a short explanation of his three laws:</p><p><strong>Law 1: The Shape of the Planet's Path</strong> Kepler discovered that the planets don't follow perfect circles, but instead move in paths called ellipses (like a flattened circle). Imagine you throw a ball, but instead of it going straight or in a circle, it goes in a curve.</p><p><strong>Law 2: The Speed of the Planet</strong> Kepler also found out that planets move at different speeds at different times. They go faster when they're close to the sun and slower when they're farther away. Think of it like a swing - you go faster when you're swinging high up, and slower when you're near the bottom.</p><p><strong>Law 3: The Longest Path</strong> Kepler realized that the longer it takes for a planet to complete one full orbit (a year on that planet), the farther it is from the sun. This means that the Earth has a pretty long year because it takes 365.25 days to orbit the sun, but Mercury has a really short year because it's much closer to the sun.</p><p>These laws were really important discoveries because they showed how the planets move in our solar system. They even helped other scientists like Isaac Newton discover more about gravity.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1461.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1463.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
