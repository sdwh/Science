On Earth, it pulls you towards the ground. In space, gravity is still working, but it's different because there's no ground to pull you towards.</p><p>Imagine you have a ball, and you throw it up in the air. On Earth, the ball comes back down because of gravity. In space, the ball will just keep floating away because there's no ground to pull it back.</p><p>However, everything in space has gravity, even you. But since you're very small compared to planets and stars, your gravity is very weak. The Earth's gravity is stronger than yours, that's why you stay on the ground when you're on Earth.</p><p>In space, the planets and stars have stronger gravity, and that's what keeps you moving around them in an orbit, like how the Moon orbits the Earth. It's like you're being pulled by an invisible string, but you're also moving really fast, so you stay in orbit instead of falling down.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=569.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=571.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
