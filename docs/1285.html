Here's a brief history:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Gregor Mendel's Experiment</strong> (1865-1866): Mendel studied pea plants to understand how traits are passed down from parents to offspring. He crossed pea plants with different characteristics, such as tall or short, and recorded the results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</strong> (1866): Mendel discovered three laws:</p></li><li>The Law of Segregation: Each trait has two versions (alleles) that separate during reproduction.</li><li>The Law of Independent Assortment: Different traits are inherited independently of each other.</li><li><p>The Law of Dominance: One version (allele) can be stronger than the other.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rediscovery of Mendel's Work</strong> (1900): Three scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak, independently discovered Mendel's laws and confirmed them through their own experiments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thomas Hunt Morgan's Experiment</strong> (1910-1915): Morgan studied fruit flies to understand how genes are inherited. He discovered that genes are linked on chromosomes and that sex chromosomes determine the sex of an organism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Development of Modern Genetics</strong> (1920s-1950s): Scientists like Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright developed mathematical models of genetics, which helped us understand how genes are inherited and how populations evolve.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discovery of DNA Structure</strong> (1953): James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, which revealed how genes are stored and transmitted from one generation to the next.</p></li></ol><p>Mendelian genetics research has come a long way since Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants. Today, we know much more about genetics and how traits are inherited, and this knowledge has led to many discoveries and advances in medicine and biotechnology.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1284.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1286.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
