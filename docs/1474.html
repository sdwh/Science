The reason behind this law is the way electric fields work.</p><p>Imagine you have a charged ball. The ball creates an electric field around itself that radiates outward in all directions. The strength of this electric field decreases as you move further away from the ball.</p><p>Now, when you bring another charged ball near the first one, the electric field from the first ball interacts with the second ball. The force between the two charged balls depends on two things:</p><ol><li>The strength of the electric fields (which depends on the charge of the balls). If the balls have bigger charges, they create stronger electric fields.</li><li>The distance between the balls. As the balls move further apart, the electric fields between them weaken.</li></ol><p>Coulomb's Law says that the force between the two charged balls is proportional to the product of their charges (bigger charges = stronger force) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (farther apart = weaker force).</p><p>Think of it like a game of tug-of-war. The charges are like the strength of the players, and the distance is like the rope. If the players are strong (big charges) and close together (short rope), they can pull each other harder. But if they're weak (small charges) and far apart (long rope), the tension is weaker.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1473.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1475.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>âœ¨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
