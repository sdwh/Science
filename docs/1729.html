These are:</p><ol><li><strong>Molar Heat of Combustion</strong>: This is the amount of heat released when one mole of a substance is completely burned in oxygen. It's like measuring the energy released when gasoline burns in a car engine.</li></ol><p>Example: The molar heat of combustion of gasoline is about -5460 kJ/mol. This means that when one mole of gasoline is burned, it releases 5460 kilojoules (kJ) of energy.</p><ol><li><strong>Molar Heat of Formation (ΔHf)</strong>: This is the amount of heat released or absorbed when one mole of a substance is formed from its individual elements in their standard state. It's like measuring the energy needed to build a LEGO castle from individual bricks.</li></ol><p>Example: The molar heat of formation of water (H2O) is about -286 kJ/mol. This means that when one mole of hydrogen gas and half a mole of oxygen gas are combined to form water, 286 kilojoules of energy are released.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Molar Heat of Neutralization</strong>: This is the amount of heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base to form a salt and water. It's like measuring the energy released when a certain type of medicine (an acid) reacts with a base (like baking soda) in your stomach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Molar Heat of Solution</strong>: This is the amount of heat released or absorbed when one mole of a substance is dissolved in a solvent (like water). It's like measuring the energy change when sugar dissolves in your morning cereal.</p></li></ol><p>These are some of the most common types of reaction heats, but there are others like molar heat of fusion, molar heat of vaporization, and so on.</p></p><hr><div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-3"><a href=1728.html class="btn btn-success">Prev</a><a href=index.html class="btn btn-secondary">Home</a><a href=1730.html class="btn btn-primary">Next</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer mt-auto py-3"><div class="container text-center"><a href=https://sdwh.dev class=text-decoration-none>✨ sdwh.dev</a></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity="sha512-ykZ1QQr0Jy/4ZkvKuqWn4iF3lqPZyij9iRv6sGqLRdTPkY69YX6+7wvVGmsdBbiIfN/8OdsI7HABjvEok6ZopQ==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script></body></html>
